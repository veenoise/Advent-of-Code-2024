# Advent of Code 2024

This is my solution for Advent of Code 2024. If you are interested in solving these challenges yourself, kindly visit: [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

## About 
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

If you'd like to support Advent of Code, you can do so indirectly by helping to [Share] it with others or directly via AoC++.
